# Data-Science

## Synopsis
This repository aims to show my current list of projects as an aspiring data scientist/developer. My language of choice is Python, and I am asking for any suggestions on how to improve each project. 

I wrote code for a web scrapper called Parser.ipynb which scrapes end-of-season standings tables for the English Premier League since the 92-93 season.  

The Final Opta XML.ipynb code tries to explore a data set provided by Opta Sports. Even though we could have easily retrieve the data using Excel, I aimed to understand how different data structures like dictionaries and lists work in Python. Also, we explore the use of the matplotlib and the pandas libraries for data analysis. 

In the KNN.ipynb, I constructed a k-nearest neighbors algorithm from scratch. Also, I evaluated the algorithm's performance on three different data sets. 

## Motivation
I dream of becoming a data scientist or a software developer. I love to spend hours coding and solving programming issues. Also, I hate repetition and I love automating things! I hope to one day utilize the skills acquired in the data world for sports analysis and predictions!.
